## Project Description
I am currently working on this [repository](https://github.com/xianglous/ml-replica) to recreate the ML algorithms & models I have learned during undergraduate studies. I hope to review the knowledge from college and gain deeper understanding of these models. Meanwhile, this repository can serve other students' and programmers' needs in implementing certain ML algorithms.

## Project Composition
This project mainly contains two parts: implementation and documentation. In implementation, I will use Python and related libraries. For documentation, I am writing on this [website](https://xianglous.github.io/ml-replica/) with pseudocode, math formula and explanation of the models.
