My name is Xianglong Li (<span style="font-family:Siyuansongti">李翔龙</span>), I am an incoming **Master of Science in Computer Science** student at Yale University. I got my **Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science** and **Data Science** at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (<span style="color:#FFCB05;font-weight:bold">Go</span> <span style="color:#00274C;font-weight:bold">Blue!</span>).
